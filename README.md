# Bookmarking

February 2016 (updated December 2017)

A NodeJS that lets me store URLs and provides a JSON interface for accessing the data.

The bookmarking 'app' is an online interface for saving links: URL, Name, Description, Category and image. This information is then stored in the database. 

The interface provides a few JSON endpoints to access the links, such as:

- /recent/n -- the most recent n links bookmarked.
